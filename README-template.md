## Overview

Before I started working on this task, I was a little bit scared wondering how I was going to work on the JS part of it which turned out to be simple at the end of the day. 
Turned out that the hard part was getting the mobile and the desktop layouts right. I learnt how important your html markup is when it gets to the layout where you get to apply your css. 
I worked on the layouts alone for about two days so it was very tough. Lots of debugging.
